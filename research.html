            Many results in probability (most famously, Strassen's theorem on stochastic domination), characterize some relationship between probability distributions in terms of the existence of a particular structured coupling between them.
            Optimal transport, and in particular Kantorovich duality, provides a framework for formally unifying these results, but the standard duality theory requires topological conditions that are not satisfied in some settings.
            In this work, we investigate the extent to which Kantorovich duality still provides meaningful connections between distributional relations and their coupling counterparts, in the topologically irregular setting.
            Towards this end, we show that Strassen's theorem "nearly holds" for topologically irregular orders but that the full theorem admits counterexamples.
            The core of the proof is a novel technical result in optimal transport, which shows that the Kantorovich dual problem is well-behaved for optimal transport problems whose cost functions can be written as a non-increasing limit of lower semi-continuous functions.

        <li class="abstract" id='abKMeansConsistency' style='display: none;'>
            A celebrated result of Pollard proves asymptotic consistency for \(k\)-means clustering when the
            population distribution has finite variance. In this work, we point out that the population-level
            \(k\)-means clustering problem is, in fact, well-posed under the weaker assumption of a finite
            expectation, and we investigate whether some form of asymptotic consistency holds in this setting.
            As we illustrate in a variety of negative results, the complete story is quite subtle; for example, 
            the empirical \(k\)-means cluster centers may fail to converge even if there exists a unique set of
            population \(k\)-means cluster centers. A detailed analysis of our negative results reveals that
            inconsistency arises because of an extreme form of cluster imbalance, whereby the presence of
            outlying samples leads to some empirical \(k\)-means clusters possessing very few points. We then
            give a collection of positive results which show that some forms of asymptotic consistency, under
            only the assumption of finite expectation, may be recovered by imposing some a priori degree of
            balance among the empirical \(k\)-means clusters.

          In the statistical problem of denoising, Bayes and empirical Bayes methods can "overshrink" their output relative to the latent variables of interest. This work is focused on constrained denoising problems which mitigate such phenomena. At the oracle level, i.e., when the latent variable
          distribution is assumed known, we apply tools from the theory of optimal transport to characterize
          the solution to (i) variance-constrained, (ii) distribution-constrained, and (iii) general-constrained denoising problems. At the empirical level, i.e., when the latent variable distribution is not
          known, we use empirical Bayes methodology to estimate these oracle denoisers. Our approach is
          modular, and transforms any suitable (unconstrained) empirical Bayes denoiser into a constrained empirical Bayes denoiser. We prove explicit rates of convergence for our proposed methodologies,
          which both extend and sharpen existing asymptotic results that have previously considered only variance constraints. We apply our methodology in two applications: one in astronomy concerning the relative chemical abundances in a large catalog of red-clump stars, and one in baseball concerning minor- and major league batting skill for rookie players.

          <i>Large deviations principle for Bures-Wasserstein barycenters</i>

          empirical Bures-Wasserstein barycenters of independent, identically-distributed samples of covariance matrices and covariance operators. As an application, we explore some consequences of our results for the phenomenon of dimension-free concentration of measure for Bures-Wasserstein barycenters. Our theory reveals a novel notion of exponential tilting in the Bures-Wasserstein space, which, in analogy with Cramér's theorem in the Euclidean case, solves the relative entropy projection problem under a constraint on the barycenter. Notably, this method of proof is easy to adapt to other geometric settings of interest; with the same method, we obtain large deviations principles for empirical barycenters in Riemannian manifolds and the univariate Wasserstein space, and we obtain large deviations upper bounds for empirical barycenters in the general multivariate Wasserstein space. In fact, our results are the first known large deviations principles for Fréchet means in any non-linear metric space.

          While there exists a well-developed asymptotic theory of Fr&eacutechet means of random variables taking values in a general "finite-dimensional" metric space, there are only a few known results in which the random variables can take values in an ``infinite-dimensional'' metric space.
          Presently, show that a natural setting for the study of probabilistic aspects of Fr&eacutechet means is that of metric spaces which admit a suitably powerful notion of "weak convergence".
          This allows us to recover, strengthen, and generalize virtually all known asymptotic theory for Fr&eacutechet means; in particular, we expand the possible geometric settings where such theorems can be applied, we reduce the moment assumptions to the provably minimal possible, and we completely remove assumption about uniquenesss.
          We also analyze many examples.

          result on consistency for \(k\)-means clustering in Euclidean space, with a focus on
          extensions in two directions: first, to problems where the data may come from interesting
          geometric settings (e.g., Riemannian manifolds, reflexive Banach spaces, or the Wasserstein space);
          second, to problems where some parameters are chosen adaptively from the data
          (e.g., \(k\)-medoids or elbow-method \(k\)-means). Towards this end, we provide a general
          theory which shows that all clustering procedures described above are strongly consistent.
          In fact, our method of proof allows us to derive many asymptotic limit theorems beyond
          strong consistency. We also remove all assumptions about uniqueness of the set of
          optimal cluster centers.

          This work resolves the following question in non-Euclidean statistics:
          Is it possible to consistently estimate the Fr&eacutechet mean set of an unknown population
          distribution, with respect to the Hausdorff metric, when given access to independent
          identically-distributed samples? Our affirmative answer is based on a careful analysis of
          the "relaxed empirical Fr&eacutechet mean set estimators" which identify the set of near-minimizers
          of the empirical Fr&eacutechet functional and where the amount of "relaxation" vanishes as the
          number of data tends to infinity. On the theoretical side, our results include exact descriptions
          of which relaxation rates give weak consistency and which give strong consistency, as well as
          a description of an estimator which (assuming only the finiteness of certain moments and a mild condition on the metric entropy of the underlying metric space) adaptively finds the fastest possible
          relaxation rate for strongly consistent estimation. On the applied side, we consider the
          problem of estimating the set of Fermat-Weber points of an unknown distribution in the
          space of equidistant trees endowed with the tropical projective metric; in this setting,
          we provide an algorithm that provably implements our adaptive estimator, and we apply this
          method to real phylogenetic data.

        <li class="abstract" id='abFrechetLimit' style='display: none;'>For \(1\le p \le \infty\), the Fr&eacutechet \(p\)-mean of a probability measure on a metric space is an important notion of central tendency that generalizes the usual notions in the real line of mean (\(p=2\)) and median (\(p=1\)).
        In this work we prove a collection of limit theorems for Fr&eacutechet means and related objects, which, in general, constitute a sequence of random closed sets.
        On the one hand, we show that many limit theorems (a strong law of large numbers, an ergodic theorem, and a large deviations principle) can be simply descended from analogous theorems on the space of probability measures via purely topological considerations.
        On the other hand, we provide the first sufficient conditions for the strong law of large numbers to hold in a \(T_2\) topology (in particular, the Fell topology), and we show that this condition is necessary in some special cases.
        We also discuss statistical and computational implications of the results herein.

        That is, on an abstract measurable space \((\Omega,\mathcal{F})\), we consider pairs \((E,\mathcal{G})\) where \(E\) is an equivalence relation on \(\Omega\) and \(\mathcal{G}\) is a sub-\(\sigma\)-algebra of \(\mathcal{F}\); we say that \((E,\mathcal{G})\) satisfies "strong duality" if \(E\) is \((\mathcal{F}\otimes\mathcal{F})\)-measurable and if for all probability measures \(\mathbb{P},\mathbb{P}'\) on \((\Omega,\mathcal{F})\) we have
        \[
          \max_{A\in\mathcal{G}}\vert \mathbb{P}(A)-\mathbb{P}'(A)\vert = \min_{\tilde{\mathbb{P}}\in\Pi(\mathbb{P},\mathbb{P}')}(1-\tilde{\mathbb{P}}(E)),

        where \(\Pi(\mathbb{P},\mathbb{P}')\) denotes the space of couplings of \(\mathbb{P}\) and \(\mathbb{P}'\), and where 
        "max" and "min" assert that the supremum and infimum are in fact achieved.
        The results herein give wide sufficient conditions for strong duality to hold, thereby extending a form of Kantorovich duality to a class of cost functions which are irregular from the point of view of topology but regular from the point of view of descriptive set theory.
        The given conditions recover or strengthen classical results, and they have novel consequences in stochastic calculus, point process theory, and random sequence simulation.
