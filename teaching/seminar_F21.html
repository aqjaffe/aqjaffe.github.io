        This semester we are studying Markov chain mixing times,
        and we will primarily be following
        <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/dlevin/MARKOV/markovmixing.pdf">
          this text by Levin, Peres, and Wilmer
        </a>.

        <li class="title">25 August,
          <b>Initial Meeting</b>.
          <!-- <a href="#">voting form</a></li> -->
        <li class="body">A casual first meeting to get to know each other and
          decide on a topic for the semester.</li>

        <li class="title">1 September, Adam Quinn Jaffe,
          <b>Introductory Talk</b>.</li>
        <li class="body">We introduce the basic convergence theorem for Markov
          chains, which states that an irreducible aperiodic Markov chain on
          a finite state space has a unique stationary distribution to which
          it converges from any initial distribution.
          Then, we heuristically describe the goal of the semester, which
          is to understand the speed of this convergence, typically in terms of
          asymptotics as the size of the chain increases.
          We also give various examples that we will later revisit throughout the
          semester.</li>

          <li class="title">8 September, Mehdi Ouaki,
            <b>Total Variation Distance, Convergence and Coupling</b>,
            Chapters 4 and 5.</li>
          <li class="body">We introduce the definition of the total variation
            distance between two probability measures and its various
            formulations. In particular, we put a particular emphasis on its
            link with the notion of coupling and show it can be used to derive
            upper bounds on mixing times. We will also briefly go over the long
            run convergence of the MC marginals to its stationary distribution
            in the TV sense and show that the speed of convergence is
            exponential.</li>

          <li class="title">15 September, Daniel Raban,
            <b>Stopping Times and Strong Stationary Times</b>,
            Chapter 6.</li>
          <li class="body">We introduce the notion of stopping times
            and, in particular, strong stationary times for Markov chains.
            We prove a general technique for proving upper bounds on mixing
            times using strong stationary times and apply the technique to
            compute upper bounds for examples, including a card-shuffling
            chain.</li>

          <li class="title">22 September, Mriganka Basu Roy Chowdhury,
            <b>Lower Bounds for Mixing Times</b>,
            Chapter 7.3.</li>
          <li class="body">After discussing methods for upper bounding
            mixing times in the past few weeks, we now look at a few techniques
            that enable us to prove lower bounds. We also discuss the random
            walk on a hypercube for which we already proved an O(n log n)
            upper bound on its mixing time, and now prove a corresponding
            O(n log n) lower bound (but with different hidden constants).</li>

          <li class="title">29 September, Yang Chu,
            <b>More Lower Bounds for Mixing Times</b>,
            Chapter 7.1, 7.2.</li>
          <li class="body">This week we will continue on lower bounds of
            mixing times. We will introduce basic methods like counting
            bounds and diameter bounds, as well as the bottleneck ratio
            which is a geometric feature of Markov chains, that will come
            up again when we discuss spectral methods. We will work on
            examples like top-to-random shuffle which has lower bound
            O(n log n), and riffle shuffle which has lower bound O(log n).</li>

          <li class="title">6 October, Zack Stier,
            <b>Time-Reversal and Reversibility</b>,
            Chapter 1.6, A.3.</li>
          <li class="body">We will discuss time-reversal of Markov chains,
            and see the wide range of effects it can have on mixing times.
            We will also begin to discuss the condition of reversibility,
            which appears in many natural chains, and begin to explore spectral
            properties of reversible Markov chains.</li>

          <li class="title">13 October, Zack Stier,
            <b>Spectral Theory of Reversible Markov Chains</b>,
            Chapter 12.1, 12.2.</li>
          <li class="body">We will leverage the useful notion of Markov
            chain reversibility to prove an analogue to the spectral theorem
            for symmetric matrices, then leverage this in turn to achieve upper
            and lower bounds for the mixing time.</li>

          <li class="title">20 October, Zachary McNulty,
            <b>Applications of Spectral Bounds to Projected and Product Chains</b>,
            Chapter 12.3.</li>
          <li class="body">Today we will discuss a few applications of the
            spectral bounds on mixing times discussed in the previous lecture.
            In particular, we will discuss two techniques for building new
            chains from existing ones, quotients and products, and how this
            spectral analysis passes naturally through these operations.</li>

          <li class="title">27 October, Karissa Huang,
            <b>Glauber Dynamics and Product Chains</b>,
            Chapter 3.3, 12.4.</li>
          <li class="body">In this talk we will introduce Glauber dynamics,
            provide a few examples, and bound the spectral gap for Glauber
            dynamics. Finally, we will return to the example of the lazy
            random walk on the hypercube, show a bound for its spectral gap
            using Glauber dynamics, and compare it to the bound obtained
            using the coupling method.</li>

          <li class="title">3 November, Ella Hiesmayr,
            <b>Bounds on the Spectral Gap</b>,
            Chapter 13.1.</li>
          <li class="body">In this talk we will first prove a bound on the
            absolute spectral gap using contractions by couplings. We will
            then apply this bound to the Glauber dynamics on the hardcore model
            that was introduced last week. In a second part, we will introduce
            an upper and lower bound on the spectral gap in terms of the
            bottleneck ratio and prove parts of that theorem.</li>

          <li class="title">10 November, Nicholas Liskij,
            <b>Path Couplings</b>,
            Chapter 14.2.</li>
          <li class="body">In this talk, we introduce the transportation metric
            and the notion of a path coupling. We then prove that a good path
            coupling gives an upper bound on the mixing time using the
            transportation metric. By applying this theorem, we get bounds
            for the exclusion process on the complete graph and for Glauber
            dynamics with q-colorings.</li>

          <li class="title">17 November, Zach Stier,
            <b>Cutoff in Families of Markov Chains</b>,
            Chapter 18.</li>
          <li class="body">In this talk, we will define the notion of cutoff
            for a family of Markov chains, discuss some (non)examples, and
            consider the necessary condition of pre-cutoff.</li>

          <li class="title">1 December, Yang Chu,
            <b>Random Walks on Groups</b>.</li>
          <li class="body">Today we focus on random walks on groups which were
            introduced at the beginning of this semester. In particular we will
            introduce tools from representation theory, i.e. Fourier analysis
            on groups, which play an important role in analyzing such Markov
            chains. We will see it's essential to study the characters of
            irreducible representations of the group.</li>

          <li class="title">8 December, Adam Quinn Jaffe,
            <b>Phase Transition for the Mixing Time of Glauber Dynamics for the Ising Model</b>,
            Chapter 15.2.</li>
          <li class="body">The Glauber dynamics for the Ising model on a
            general graph is believed to be fast-mixing at high temperatures
            and slow-mixing at low temperatures. In this talk we prove a
            rigorous version of this statement for the complete graph.
            That is, we identify a critical temperature above which the mixing
            time is at most N log N and below which the mixing time is at
            least exponential in N.</li>
          </ul>
